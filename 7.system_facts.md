1)If you need to search anything in the ansible configuration,just type the following

```
ansible all -m setup -a 'filter=ansible_memory'

All you have to do is in the filter tab make sure you provide the exact filter.

```
ansible all -m setup
```

With this command it will help you to get the values needed to search
