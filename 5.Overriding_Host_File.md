1)List the hosts

```
ansible all --list-hosts
```


Output:

```
[ansible@darshanphegde1c ansible]$ ansible all --list-hosts
  hosts (3):
    darshanphegde2c.mylabserver.com
    darshanphegde3c.mylabserver.com
    localhost
```

2)Test whether we can ping to apacheweb servers which are defined in /etc/ansible/hosts file

```
ansible apacheweb -m ping
```

```
[ansible@darshanphegde1c ansible]$ ansible apacheweb -m ping
darshanphegde2c.mylabserver.com | SUCCESS => {
    "changed": false, 
    "ping": "pong"
}
```

3)If we need to just check the hosts which are mentioned in the hosts file, then we need to run the following command.But before that we create another hosts file in your present path and add the values


```
Ex: 

[test]
test.hostname.com

```

When you do the above, you need the run the command differently

```
ansible test -i hosts -m ping
```
