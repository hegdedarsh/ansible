1)Change the sudoers file for ansible user to make sure it doesnt prompt for password

```
sudo visudo
```

Change the following or add the following based on your sudoers file
```
ansible        ALL=(ALL)     NOPASSWD:  ALL
```


2)To make sure your localhost also works,you need to copy the ssh to yourself


```
ssh-copy-id localhost
```

3)Now when you test for ping, it will work for localhost



```
ansible all -m ping 
```



Output:

```
ansible@darshanphegde1c ansible]$ ansible -m ping all
darshanphegde2c.mylabserver.com | SUCCESS => {
    "changed": false, 
    "ping": "pong"
}
darshanphegde3c.mylabserver.com | SUCCESS => {
    "changed": false, 
    "ping": "pong"
}
localhost | SUCCESS => {
    "changed": false, 
    "ping": "pong"
}

```
