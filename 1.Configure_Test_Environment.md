1) Generate public and private key pair on the first server


```
ssh-keygen
```


Output:

```
[cloud_user@darshanphegde1c ~]$ ssh-keygen
Generating public/private rsa key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/home/cloud_user/.ssh/id_rsa): 
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): 
Enter same passphrase again: 
Your identification has been saved in /home/cloud_user/.ssh/id_rsa.
Your public key has been saved in /home/cloud_user/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.
The key fingerprint is:
SHA256:M6dzS+0irQySSzVUivlj0AshdKidtd4zLCwRJZEFRw4 cloud_user@darshanphegde1c.mylabserver.com
The key's randomart image is:

2)Exchange the public key with server2

```
ssh-copy-id 52.221.200.23
```


Output:

```
cloud_user@darshanphegde1c .ssh]$ ssh-copy-id 52.221.200.23
