## Using Centos7

1)Create a user called ansible

```
adduser ansible
passwd ansible
```


2)Switch to ansible user and then create a directory called playbooks

```
sudo su - ansible
mkdir playbooks
```



3)Follow the above steps for 3 servers 



4) Generate public and private key pair on the first server,similarly for the second and then for the third server.


```
ssh-keygen
```


Output:

```
[cloud_user@darshanphegde1c ~]$ ssh-keygen
Generating public/private rsa key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/home/cloud_user/.ssh/id_rsa): 
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): 
Enter same passphrase again: 
Your identification has been saved in /home/cloud_user/.ssh/id_rsa.
Your public key has been saved in /home/cloud_user/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.
The key fingerprint is:
SHA256:M6dzS+0irQySSzVUivlj0AshdKidtd4zLCwRJZEFRw4 cloud_user@darshanphegde1c.mylabserver.com
The key's randomart image is:

5)Copy the ssh key  generated from server1 to server2 and try to check whether we can login without password

```
ssh-copy-id 172.31.24.152
```



Output:
