This is an example for errorhandling to make sure even if the one of the tasks fail , the rest of it should continue


```yaml
--- # error handling example
- hosts: apacheweb
  user: ansible
  sudo: yes
  connection: ssh
  gather_facts: no
  tasks:
    - name: Execute a command that will fail
      command: /bin/false
      ignore_errors: yes
    - name: Install telnet
      yum: pkg=telnet state=latest
 ```
